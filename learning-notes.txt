/* To do on another project: 
SCSS: 
- maybe add more variables, @each to map over lists, for loops, if else logic.... But I'm thinking maybe just leave this for another project. 
- watch this tut, then implement similar changes into my project.

/* Some SCSS Notes: 
nesting makes it a whole lot more readable. 
However, a lot of classes that previously didn't need nesting now need nesting e.g. media queries. line 427 for slideshow-product @ min-width: 820px. previously I wrote it like this: 
@media (min-width: 820px) {
  .slideshow-product {
    height: initial;
  }
}
now I have to write it like this: 
@media (min-width: 820px) {
  .slideshow .slideshow-image .slideshow-product {
    height: initial;
  }
}
because it's nested in the non-media query ver, the media query ver needs to be nested. 
- I could try putting the media query inside the nested element. e.g. 
    .slideshow-image {
      margin-bottom: 2.2em;
  
      .slideshow-product {
        max-width: 450px;
        border-radius: 15px;
        height: 300px;
      }
      @media (min-width: 820px) {
        .slideshow-product {
          height: initial;
        }
      }
    }

I don't need to do this for .slideshow-thumbnails, with the difference being the media query is (max-width: ...) not min-width

/* JS Notes: 
How to do img slider by changing the img url instead of adding 'show' classes to the img. 
let slideshowImageUrls = [
  './images/image-product-1.jpg', 
  './images/image-product-2.jpg', 
  './images/image-product-3.jpg', 
  './images/image-product-4.jpg', 
]

inside the thumbnail event listener add the following (replacing the add/show slideshow image code): 
  slideshowImage[0].src = slideshowImageUrls[index];
 
-----------------------
the thumbnail doesn't update the currently selected main image on page load. 
I can explore this later. either: 
  reset image current slide to 0 when page goes from 819px or below to 820+px. 
  or change thumbnail code to update value. 

-----------------------
the isCartEmpty function makes it so the function doesn't keep running if the cart is not empty. 
if the cart already has 1 item in it and we add another, we don't need to run the if(cart ===0) {display empty} function, every time we click the addToBtn. 
for performance.
it'll probably make the code more harder to read when I try to re-read it back.

/* JS Junk: 
   To Do 
  shopping cart show/display onclick XX 
  button increment and decrement to change the number value. XX 
  mobile menu show/hide (or maybe I want to do transform instead). XX

  slideshow DESKTOP: 
    - remove active class from all thumnbnails + add active class to currently selected thumbnail XX
    - switch big picture on click of thumbnail. XX
  slideshow MOBILE: 
    - prev button makes slideshow display prev img. XX
    - next button makes slideshow display next img. XX

  add to cart button: 
    adds current number of selected item to cart. XX
    updates cart-icon number XX
    updates quantity + total cost in cart XX

  shopping cart delete button: XX
    reset shopping cart values. XX
    display the empty html code block XX

  add to cart: 
    if shopping cart = 0, display empty html code block  XX 
    else display the other code block. XX

  slideshow modal: 
    - popup modal for big image. XX
    - same functionality as desktop slideshow. XX
    - when clicking next and prev buttons, update the correct active thumbnail. XX 
    - fix: when clicking on my slideshow, the same img is the 1 that appears on the modal. 
    - bonus: add and minus btns on shopping cart. 

  Refactor code: 
    - the code seems a bit janky now w/ the modal. the html of it, the css, the js the probably runs on both slideshow images when I click on modal thumbnails, etc. 
    - on my thumbnails I have slideshow-thumbnail and .slideshow-thumbnail wrapper. it's pointless to have these classes seperate. put all code in 1 class. 
    - in my slideshow code, I have the prev/next and thumbnails working seperately, so it doesn't work properly on the modal. need to change this. 

    --> the problem is my modal slider is regestering the currentSlide as 4,5,6,7 instead of 0,1,2,3. 
        that's because I've copied and pasted the slider, so now my slideshow images has 8 img's (since og 4 was copied, x2 = 8)
        I'd have to use specificity by adding a class above called og-slideshow slideshow-product for og slideshow and another class called modal-slideshow. 
    -- if I think about it, I don't want the bg slideshow to change when I change the modal slideshow. so that means I need 2 different slideshows. 
        -- the same classes for the same design. 
        -- but different ID's for 2 seperate slideshow events in javascript.
